1. [Max of two numbers](ocaml-basics/max-of-two/)
1. [Absolute value](ocaml-basics/absolute-value/)
1. [From type to function #1](ocaml-basics/fun-of-type-1/)
1. [Find a function #1](ocaml-basics/find-fun-1/)
1. [Highest card wins](ocaml-basics/highest-card-wins/)
1. [From type to function #2](ocaml-basics/fun-of-type-2/)
1. [Even and odd](ocaml-basics/even-odd/)
1. [Comparing fractions](ocaml-basics/fractions/)
1. [Reverse a list](ocaml-basics/rev-list)
1. [Minimum of a function](ocaml-basics/minfun)

1. [Student grades](ocaml-basics/cumlaude)
1. [Duplicates](ocaml-basics/dup)
1. [Random list](ocaml-basics/rnd-list)
1. [From list to string](ocaml-basics/string-of-list)
1. [Min and max of a function](ocaml-basics/minmax)
1. [Extract an element from a list](ocaml-basics/extract)
1. [Alternating-even numbers](ocaml-basics/alt-even)
1. [Binary search trees](ocaml-basics/binary-search-tree)
1. [Deck of cards](ocaml-basics/deck-of-cards)
1. [The return of the Pumping Lemma](ocaml-basics/pumping-lemma)
1. [List crush](ocaml-basics/list-crush)
1. [Longest subsequence](ocaml-basics/longsub)

## Arithmetic expressions

1. [A minimal language of boolean expressions](expr/boolexpr)
1. [Boolean expressions with not, and, or](expr/andboolexpr)
